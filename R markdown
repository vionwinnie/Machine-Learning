Introduction

This is where I preset the working conditions to speed things up when building the model. 

```{r,include=FALSE, cache=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(parallel)
library(doParallel)
library(caret)
cluster <- makeCluster(detectCores() - 1) # convention to leave 1 core for OS
registerDoParallel(cluster)
fitControl <- trainControl(method = "cv",
                           number = 10,
                           allowParallel = TRUE)
setwd("/Users/vionwinnie/Coursera")
```
Reading and Cleaning Data

Now I run the training, testing, and validation set. I have decided to exclude extraneous timestamp and columns that has a majority of NAs in the datasets. So I have to clean it up before I run it.

```{r}
original <- read.csv("pml-training.csv")
validation <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv")

inBuild <- createDataPartition(y=original$classe,
                               p=0.7, list=FALSE)
training <- original[-inBuild,]; testing <- original[inBuild,]


training <- training[,-1]
testing <- testing[,-1]
validation <- validation[,-1]
indexing <- !colSums(is.na(validation))
training <- training[,indexing==TRUE]
training <- training[,-c(3,4,5)]
testing <- testing[,indexing==TRUE]
testing <- testing[,-c(3,4,5)]
validation <- validation[,indexing==TRUE]
validation <- validation[,-c(3,4,5)]
```

Training the data

I decided to try both gbm method and lda method to train the data and test its accuracy.
```{r}
library(randomForest)
mod2 <- train(classe ~ .,data=training,method="gbm",trControl = fitControl)
mod3 <- train(classe ~ .,data=training,method="lda",trControl = fitControl)

gbmresult <- predict(mod2, testing)
ldaresult <- predict(mod3, testing)
cmtree <- confusionMatrix(gbmresult, testing$classe)
cmtree2 <- confusionMatrix(ldaresult, testing$classe)
print(cmtree$overall['Accuracy'])
print(cmtree2$overall['Accuracy'])
```

Compare the two models accuracy, I went with the gbm approach to predict the validation set.My result returns 100% when I completed the quiz.

```{r}
gbmresult1 <- predict(mod2,validation)
```
